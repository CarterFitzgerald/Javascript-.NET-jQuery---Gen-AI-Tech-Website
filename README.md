# Javascript-.NET-jQuery---Gen-AI-Tech-Website
 
This website was designed for my Web Development and Programming Unit and I acheived a mark of 33.75/40. The project utiises ASP.NET Core Web App, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery and Python. Unfortunately, at the time I was extremely busy, so the webpage isn't completely responsive on every page, but all the core features which needed to be included, I had.
